;; "It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures." â€” Alan Perlis, Epigrams on Programming,
;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigrams_on_Programming

;; There's a good argument to move this to resources/edn, and slurp it in, but this is a Clients-side ClojureScript project,
;; there's too many ways we can read the data. Keeping it in its own namespace keeps it simple and works with both Java and JavaScript.
;; To read the file in Clojure see: https://github.com/clojure-cookbook/clojure-cookbook/blob/master/04_local-io/4-04_get-local-resource.asciidoc

;; Clojure excels at turning data from one form to another.
;; That philosophy is informing this implementation.
;; It focuses on updating the state. The drawing functions will be just a view of this stae.
